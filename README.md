# random_nonsense
spit out random aerospace related nonsense

This is just a simple code in Rust & Sqlite to practice the syntax and learn. nothing serious or crazy. 
this will generate an output of random stuff using rusqlite crate.


ALSO why are you still reading? there's nothing special in this project. nothing special at all.
